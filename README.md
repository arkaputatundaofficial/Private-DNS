# 🔒 Private DNS Manager (Android)

A simple, lightweight Android app that lets you **configure and manage Private DNS** on your device with ease — without digging through system settings every time.

This app is built for users who care about **privacy, security, and control** over their network experience.


## ✨ What is this app?

Android supports **Private DNS** (DNS over TLS) to encrypt DNS queries and protect users from tracking, ads, and malicious domains.  
However, managing it through system settings is often **hidden, tedious, and inconvenient**.

**Private DNS Manager** simplifies this by providing:
- A clean interface
- Quick access to Private DNS configuration
- Easy switching between DNS providers
- Safe permission-based operation

- 🌐 Set custom DNS provider hostnames  
- 🔁 Quickly switch between DNS configurations  
- 🧼 Minimal, distraction-free UI  
- 🚫 No ads, no trackers  
- ⚡ Lightweight & fast  

## 🧠 How the app works

- The app uses **Android’s official Private DNS APIs**
- It **does NOT intercept or modify your traffic**
- All DNS changes happen at the **system level**
- No background services running unnecessarily
- No data is collected or sent anywhere

> 🔐 Your privacy stays entirely on your device.
